📘 Student Record System – README 📌 Overview

The Student Record System is a simple Java-based console application designed to manage student details. It uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and method overriding.

The application allows users to:

Add new student records

Display all stored student records

Automatically calculate grades based on marks

🧱 Features ✔ OOP Concepts Used

Inheritance: Student class inherits from Person class.

Encapsulation: Sensitive fields like rollNo, course, marks are private.

Method Overriding: toString() is overridden to print student details properly.

Input Validation: Ensures marks are between 0 and 100.
